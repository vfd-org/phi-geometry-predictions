📄 Overview

This repository contains the technical note:

“Falsifiable φ-Geometry Predictions for Strain-Induced Magnetism and Neural Resonance”

This document accompanies a public long-form post on X/Twitter titled:

“Upcoming Papers Will Reveal Hidden φ-Geometry in Magnetism, Strain Physics & Neural Resonance — Here Are the Predictions.”

The purpose of this repository is to provide a timestamped, citable, scientific version of those predictions. It does not describe the full Vibrational Field Dynamics (VFD) framework.
Instead, it records the precise numerical signatures expected to appear in upcoming experimental papers across:

condensed matter physics

magnetism

superconductivity

photonics

systems neuroscience

quantum biology

These signatures are falsifiable and are intentionally published before the corresponding experiments appear in PRL, PRB, Nature, Neuron, and other journals.

🔬 Summary of Predictions

The PDF provides detailed predictions, including:

Condensed Matter & Magnetism

C1: φ-related coefficients (1.618 or 0.618) in strain-induced spin-splitting fits

C2: Nonlinear Zeeman-type effects with φ⁻² curvature

C3: Universal EM correction term δₑₘ ≈ 0.0540–0.0542

C4: φ-scaled ratios in superconducting strain responses

Neuroscience & Quantum Biology

N1: Narrow-band neural coherence at ≈87 Hz

N2: φ-scaled timing/stability constants (e.g., 1.62×10⁻² s)

N3: Cross-domain recurrence of φ, φ⁻¹, φ⁻², δₑₘ, and 87 Hz

These predictions will be confirmed or falsified by independent research groups.

🧪 Falsifiability

This work makes quantitative predictions that can be disproven:

If upcoming papers do not report φ-related coefficients

If strain–splitting curves do not show φ⁻² curvature

If 87 Hz does not emerge as a coherence band

If predicted EM corrections do not appear

…then the underlying geometric assumptions of VFD are incorrect or incomplete.

If multiple domains do independently reproduce these numbers, it suggests a deeper φ-structured geometry underlying matter, electromagnetism, and neural coherence.

🧠 About VFD (Vibrational Field Dynamics)

VFD is a developing geometric model seeking to unify:

electromagnetic torsion

geometric resonance

condensed matter responses

neural integration dynamics

This repository does not detail the full theory; it only records falsifiable outcomes that follow from it.

A full technical monograph is in preparation.
